## ChallengeWeek3
This repository contains the solutions to the Challenge Week 3.

### What was the challenge?
Your task is to create a Jenkins pipeline that takes this [app](https://gitlab.com/qacdevops/nbs-challenge-3) and on every push to the repository, tests the app, creates the docker image and pushes the image to a Nexus repository.

### How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be very engaging and challenging for sure. 
It will involve techonologie that we have learnt in the week including Jenkins, Nexus and Docker.

### What went well?
The task started off on a good note. Initially did have issues with GitHub cloning and adding but that was resolved. 
I think I am getting better at GitHub commands now. I feel confident in Docker and writing scripts so that went really well.
The videos are really good and are immensely valuable content. Great work Ben!

### What didn't go as planned?
Did have some issues with pytest but that was resolved with some Google research.
Started off with two .sh files but realised that run should have its own entity, took some time in understanding that logic as its different from push.

### Possible improvements for future challenges.
Keep asking questions in the training on anything that does not seem to make sense, that should make it easier for the challenge.

Thank you.
